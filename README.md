> **New here? Start at [the learning path](00_index/learning-path.md).** It walks you from first-contact to confident in a sensible order — read that before this table.

## Who this is for

A working DevOps engineer's quick-reference: first-contact notes, runnable examples, and configs for Git, Bash, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Prometheus, Grafana, Python, and more.
Use it as a shelf you grab from while designing, debugging, or reviewing a system — not as a substitute for each tool's official docs.
It deliberately leaves out customer-specific credentials, environment secrets, and a full tutorial for every product.

## What's in here

This kit is organized around Git, Bash, Docker, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, Ansible, Prometheus, Grafana, Python, repo-doc, and foundational DevOps concepts.
The repository holds content files across notes, docs, scripts, snippets, configs, manifests, notebooks, Dockerfiles, and reusable templates.
`docs/concepts/` holds the conceptual spine; each tool folder holds the material you reach for when putting those ideas into practice.

## Quick links

- [Shared shell lint-and-test composite action](gha/configs/shared-shell-ci/action.yml) — reusable action that runs ShellCheck and shell tests with independently toggleable stages and outputs callers can gate on.
- [Shared shell CI caller workflow](gha/configs/shared-shell-ci-caller.yaml) — example caller showing zero-argument defaults, per-call overrides, and downstream jobs gated on the shared action's outputs.
- [Bash parallel execution patterns](bash/scripts/parallel-execution-patterns.sh) — xargs process slots, GNU parallel, and a named-pipe pool for running shell work in parallel.
- [Bash advanced parameter expansion](bash/snippets/parameter-expansion-advanced.sh) — global substitution, prefix/suffix stripping, and nested expansions without spawning subshells.
- [Jenkins + GitHub Actions + Argo CD progressive delivery](jenkins/docs/integrating-jenkins-github-actions-argocd-progressive-delivery.md) — splitting delivery across Jenkins builds, GitHub Actions policy checks, and Argo CD progressive sync.

## Layout

- `00_index/` — the map, quick links, glossary, and learning path for the kit.
- `docs/concepts/` — foundational concepts and cross-tool integration patterns.
- `ansible/` — idempotent automation, collections, inventories, and Kubernetes handoffs.
- `bash/` — shell fundamentals, robust script patterns, debugging, and reusable scaffolds.
- `docker/` — images, Compose, Buildx, registries, and container delivery patterns.
- `gha/` — GitHub Actions workflows, reusable actions, triggers, and local debugging.
- `git/` — repositories, branches, hooks, worktrees, releases, and CI integration.
- `grafana/` — dashboards, provisioning, alerts, and Jsonnet-oriented dashboard code.
- `helm/` — chart structure, values, templates, testing, and registry workflows.
- `jenkins/` — controllers, jobs, declarative pipelines, credentials, and SCM-backed Jenkinsfiles.
- `k8s/` — Kubernetes objects, kubectl, Helm/Argo CD flows, and local clusters.
- `prom/` — Prometheus setup, PromQL, service discovery, and alerting.
- `python/` — Python fundamentals, configuration, async tooling, and DevOps integrations.
- `repo-doc/` — repository coverage and documentation-maintenance utilities.
- `scripting-automation-philosophy/` — the companion note for repeatable automation habits.
- `tf/` — Terraform projects, state, validation, manifests, and Terragrunt layouts.

## Coverage

Counts include files nested inside template trees. `Other` is a root-level support file that does not belong to a content category.

## Status

Currently expanding Jenkins controller setup (Configuration as Code, shared libraries, progressive delivery with GitHub Actions and Argo CD), reusable GitHub Actions for shell lint-and-test gates, and Bash parallel-execution patterns.
