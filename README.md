## Who this is for

A working DevOps engineer's quick-reference: first-contact notes, runnable snippets, and configs for Git, Bash, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, Ansible, AWX, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Prometheus, Grafana, and Python.
Use it as a shelf you grab from while designing, debugging, or reviewing a system — not as a tutorial site, and not as a substitute for any tool's official documentation.
It deliberately leaves out credentials, environment secrets, and a walkthrough for every product it touches.

## What's in here

Notes, scripts, configs, manifests, and reusable templates for the tooling a DevOps engineer actually operates: version control and shell first, then containers and orchestration, then infrastructure as code and CI/CD, with observability and dashboarding on top.
`docs/concepts/` holds the conceptual spine — eight foundational primers, each with runnable companions — and every tool folder holds the material you reach for when putting those ideas into practice.
The `templates/` subfolders are copy-in starting points: a chart, a role, a collection, a repository, or a release workflow you can adopt wholesale rather than write from scratch.
The `awx/` folder covers the Tower-side control plane — job templates, inventories, and credentials — for teams that have outgrown running playbooks by hand.

## Quick links

- [Execution Environment build pipeline scaffold](ansible/templates/execution-environment-build-pipeline/README.md) — four fixed stages (build → SBOM → scan → push) over a digest-pinned base image, where the push does not happen until the vulnerability gate passes.
- [EE build Containerfile](ansible/templates/execution-environment-build-pipeline/Containerfile) — resolves the Galaxy requirements in a build-only stage, then copies just the result into the stage that ships.
- [EE build script](ansible/templates/execution-environment-build-pipeline/build-ee.sh) — runs those four stages in order, and refuses to start at all when the build tool or the scanner is missing.
- [EE requirements.yml](ansible/templates/execution-environment-build-pipeline/requirements.yml) — the Galaxy collections an execution environment pins, so the set is a reviewable input rather than whatever the controller happened to have installed.
- [EE environment template](ansible/templates/execution-environment-build-pipeline/.env.example) — placeholder for the approved base image digest; the build script rejects the placeholder, so an unpinned base cannot reach a released image by accident.

## Layout

- `00_index/` — the map, quick links, glossary, and learning path for the kit.
- `docs/concepts/` — foundational concept primers and cross-tool integration patterns.
- `ansible/` — idempotent automation, collections, inventories, execution environments, and Kubernetes handoffs.
- `awx/` — job templates, inventories, credentials, and the API behind the Tower control plane.
- `bash/` — shell fundamentals, robust script patterns, debugging, and reusable scaffolds.
- `docker/` — images, Compose, Buildx, registries, and container delivery patterns.
- `gha/` — GitHub Actions workflows, reusable actions, triggers, and local debugging.
- `git/` — repositories, branches, hooks, worktrees, releases, and CI integration.
- `grafana/` — dashboards, provisioning, alerts, and Jsonnet-oriented dashboard code.
- `helm/` — chart structure, values, templates, testing, and registry workflows.
- `jenkins/` — controllers, jobs, declarative pipelines, credentials, and SCM-backed Jenkinsfiles.
- `k8s/` — Kubernetes objects, kubectl, Helm/Argo CD flows, and local clusters.
- `prom/` — Prometheus setup, PromQL, service discovery, and alerting.
- `python/` — Python fundamentals, configuration, async tooling, and DevOps integrations.
- `repo-doc/` — repository coverage and documentation-maintenance utilities.
- `scripting-automation-philosophy/` — the companion config for the scripting deploy-checklist snippet.
- `tf/` — Terraform projects, state, validation, manifests, and Terragrunt layouts.

## Coverage

Counts include files nested inside template trees. `Src` and `Hooks` are support locations that only a few tools use.
In the `docs/concepts/` row, `Notes` counts the eight foundational primers alongside their companion notes and `Docs` the cross-tool concept articles.

## Status

Currently hardening the places where automation quietly stops being reproducible on somebody else's runner: an execution environment whose collection set and base image are both reviewable inputs, and a Grafana install whose dashboards exist without a UI click. Just landed: an execution-environment build pipeline that resolves pinned Galaxy requirements in a build stage and will not push until the vulnerability scan passes, a unified-alerting reference that keeps rule, contact-point, and notification-policy files in matching folders so the UID linking them cannot rot, and a Grafana-on-Kubernetes manifest wiring a PVC, an Ingress, and a dashboard sidecar together in the order that keeps the pod out of CrashLoopBackOff.
