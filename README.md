> **New here? Start at [the learning path](00_index/learning-path.md).** It walks you from first-contact to confident in a sensible order — read that before this table.

## Who this is for

A working DevOps engineer's quick-reference: first-contact notes, runnable snippets, and configs for Git, Bash, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, Ansible, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Prometheus, Grafana, and Python.
Use it as a shelf you grab from while designing, debugging, or reviewing a system — not as a tutorial site, and not as a substitute for any tool's official documentation.
It deliberately leaves out credentials, environment secrets, and a walkthrough for every product it touches.

## What's in here

Notes, scripts, configs, manifests, and reusable templates for the tooling a DevOps engineer actually operates: version control and shell first, then containers and orchestration, then infrastructure as code and CI/CD, with observability and dashboarding on top.
`docs/concepts/` holds the conceptual spine — eight foundational primers, each with runnable companions — and every tool folder holds the material you reach for when putting those ideas into practice.
The `templates/` subfolders are copy-in starting points: a chart, a role, a collection, a repository, or a release workflow you can adopt wholesale rather than write from scratch.

## Quick links

- [Repository dispatch with retry](gha/scripts/repository-dispatch-retry/action.yml) — a custom action that fires a `repository_dispatch` event and retries only transient failures, with jittered backoff that respects `Retry-After`.
- [Input-validated deploy gate](gha/configs/input-validated-deploy-gate/action.yml) — a composite action that validates environment, mode, and replica count up front, then runs plan and apply conditionally and reports what ran.
- [Docker build wrapper](docker/scripts/docker-build-wrapper.sh) — one entry point for a buildx build with registry cache reuse, SBOM and provenance attestations, and a Trivy scan gate that fails the run.
- [Microservices multistage scaffold](docker/templates/microservices-multistage-scaffold/README.md) — a Compose stack where every built service uses a two-stage Dockerfile, with health-gated startup and file-based secrets.
- [Signed image promotion for GitOps](docker/manifests/gitops-image-promotion.yaml) — moves one built digest through dev, staging, and prod without rebuilding, verifying its signature before each step.

## Layout

- `00_index/` — the map, quick links, glossary, and learning path for the kit.
- `docs/concepts/` — foundational concept primers and cross-tool integration patterns.
- `ansible/` — idempotent automation, collections, inventories, and Kubernetes handoffs.
- `bash/` — shell fundamentals, robust script patterns, debugging, and reusable scaffolds.
- `docker/` — images, Compose, Buildx, registries, and container delivery patterns.
- `gha/` — GitHub Actions workflows, reusable actions, triggers, and local debugging.
- `git/` — repositories, branches, hooks, worktrees, releases, and CI integration.
- `grafana/` — dashboards, provisioning, alerts, and Jsonnet-oriented dashboard code.
- `helm/` — chart structure, values, templates, testing, and registry workflows.
- `jenkins/` — controllers, jobs, declarative pipelines, credentials, and SCM-backed Jenkinsfiles.
- `k8s/` — Kubernetes objects, kubectl, Helm/Argo CD flows, and local clusters.
- `prom/` — Prometheus setup, PromQL, service discovery, and alerting.
- `python/` — Python fundamentals, configuration, async tooling, and DevOps integrations.
- `repo-doc/` — repository coverage and documentation-maintenance utilities.
- `scripting-automation-philosophy/` — the companion config for the scripting deploy-checklist snippet.
- `tf/` — Terraform projects, state, validation, manifests, and Terragrunt layouts.

## Coverage

Counts include files nested inside template trees. `Src` and `Hooks` are support locations that only a few tools use.
In the `docs/concepts/` row, `Notes` counts the eight foundational primers alongside their companion notes and `Docs` the cross-tool concept articles.

## Status

Currently hardening the two places automation most often fails quietly: reusable actions that must do the right thing with a caller's input, and image delivery where a green build is not the same as a shippable artifact. Just landed: a `repository_dispatch` action that retries only transient failures, a composite deploy gate that validates its inputs before it acts, and a Docker build wrapper that turns cache reuse, SBOM attestation, and a vulnerability scan into one command.
