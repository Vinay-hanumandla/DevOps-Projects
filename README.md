## Who this is for

A working DevOps engineer's quick-reference: first-contact notes, runnable snippets, and configs for Git, Bash, Docker, Compose, Kubernetes, Helm, Helm Charts, Terraform, Terraform Cloud, Ansible, AWX, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Prometheus, Kube-Prometheus, Grafana, and Python.
Use it as a shelf you grab from while designing, debugging, or reviewing a system — not as a tutorial site, and not as a substitute for any tool's official documentation.
It deliberately leaves out credentials, environment secrets, and a walkthrough for every product it touches.

## What's in here

Notes, scripts, configs, manifests, and reusable templates for the tooling a DevOps engineer actually operates: version control and shell first, then containers and orchestration, then infrastructure as code and CI/CD, with observability and dashboarding on top.
`docs/concepts/` holds the conceptual spine — eight foundational primers, each with runnable companions — and every tool folder holds the material you reach for when putting those ideas into practice.
The `templates/` subfolders are copy-in starting points: a chart, a role, a collection, a repository, or a release workflow you can adopt wholesale rather than write from scratch.
The `awx/` folder covers the Tower-side control plane — job templates, inventories, and credentials — for teams that have outgrown running playbooks by hand.
The `kprom/` folder wraps the kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart for cluster-native monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager.
The `compose/` folder holds first-contact Compose notes and a minimal web-plus-db starting file, `hchart/` unpacks Helm chart anatomy from public charts to minimal installs, and `tfc/` records first contact with Terraform Cloud workspaces and the cloud backend block.

## Quick links

- [Branch protection policy workflow](git/templates/branch-protection-policy/README.md) — keeps the default branch's required reviews, status checks, and linear-history rules in a reviewed JSON file, applied by script or workflow, with a drift check and a rollback path.
- [Apply-protection script](git/templates/branch-protection-policy/scripts/apply-protection.sh) — pushes the checked-in policy file to the repository's live branch-protection settings through the REST API.
- [Branch protection policy file](git/templates/branch-protection-policy/policy/branch-protection.json) — the version-controlled policy itself: required reviews, required status checks, linear history, and stale-review dismissal.
- [Advanced Git workflow patterns](git/docs/advanced-git-workflow-patterns.md) — monorepo organisation with path-scoped ownership, required commit signing, and scripted `git bisect` runs for locating regressions mechanically.
- [Stale-branch cleanup report](repo-doc/snippets/2026-10-15-stale-branch-cleanup.sh) — one small read-only report: branches merged into main past a day cutoff, commit-message shape for the last ten commits, and leftover dependency pins worth a glance.

## Layout

- `00_index/` — the map, quick links, glossary, and learning path for the kit.
- `docs/concepts/` — foundational concept primers and cross-tool integration patterns.
- `ansible/` — idempotent automation, collections, inventories, execution environments, and Kubernetes handoffs.
- `awx/` — job templates, inventories, credentials, and the API behind the Tower control plane.
- `bash/` — shell fundamentals, robust script patterns, debugging, and reusable scaffolds.
- `compose/` — Docker Compose first-contact notes and a minimal multi-service starting file.
- `docker/` — images, Compose, Buildx, registries, and container delivery patterns.
- `gha/` — GitHub Actions workflows, reusable actions, triggers, and local debugging.
- `git/` — repositories, branches, hooks, worktrees, releases, and CI integration.
- `grafana/` — dashboards, provisioning, alerts, and Jsonnet-oriented dashboard code.
- `hchart/` — Helm Charts packaging: chart anatomy, releases, values, templates, hooks, and repositories.
- `helm/` — chart structure, values, templates, testing, and registry workflows.
- `jenkins/` — controllers, jobs, declarative pipelines, credentials, and SCM-backed Jenkinsfiles.
- `k8s/` — Kubernetes objects, kubectl, Helm/Argo CD flows, and local clusters.
- `kprom/` — Kube-Prometheus stack: the kube-prometheus-stack chart, local values, and notes for cluster-native Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager on Kubernetes.
- `prom/` — Prometheus setup, PromQL, service discovery, and alerting.
- `python/` — Python fundamentals, configuration, async tooling, and DevOps integrations.
- `repo-doc/` — repository coverage and documentation-maintenance utilities.
- `scripting-automation-philosophy/` — the companion config for the scripting deploy-checklist snippet.
- `tf/` — Terraform projects, state, validation, manifests, reusable module scaffolding, and Terragrunt layouts.
- `tfc/` — Terraform Cloud workspaces, remote runs, and variables for the hosted Terraform service.

## Coverage

Counts include files nested inside template trees. `Src` and `Hooks` are support locations that only a few tools use. A folder's total (see `00_index/topics.md`) also counts root-level support dotfiles such as `docker/.dockerignore`, which has no category column here.
In the `docs/concepts/` row, `Notes` counts the eight foundational primers alongside their companion notes and `Docs` the cross-tool concept articles.

## Status

Currently keeping the default branch honest: a branch-protection-policy template that stores required reviews, status checks, and linear-history rules in a reviewed JSON file with apply, verify, and rollback scripts, plus an advanced-workflow reference covering monorepo organisation, required commit signing, and scripted `git bisect` runs. Alongside that, a read-only stale-branch cleanup report for the kit's own housekeeping.
